Well luckily this one has a special §a§osilk touch§o§f enchantment that you will most definitely need. I noticed the §8§7§oUnraveld Fabric§o§f that is the constitution of this place has a rather unique property. If you mine some of it up with that handy pickaxe I got for you, we should be able to make something with it to escape.\n\n     But be careful! Transporting across dimensions is not an exact science, so the pickaxe I got for you has a rather low §o§c§odurability §o§fvalue. Do not go wasting it, because I will not be able to get another one.",
